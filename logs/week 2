I spent a lot of this week doing additional research into testing and selecting the technologies to be used
I started to think about what would be most effective for the users in terms of technology platform.
Taking useful advice I began to look into appcelerator, jquery mobile and firebase.
Appcelerator is great for cross platform development and uses javascript which is a language I am already familiar with which is 
greatly helpful to complete this project.
JQuery mobile is ideal to create web applications that appear like mobile applications but take away the need to download and install 
applications as well as taking up storage space on your phone, it also allows for the use of the application on desktops and tablets.
Appcelerator does also allow for web development but JQuery mobile is a lot easier to learn and use (solely my opinion).
With that being said, I chose to change the scope of this project just a bit and will be using JQuery mobile to develop a 
higly responsive web application.
I also looked into Google Firebase and realized that it has a lot of helpful tools as it allows for authentication, cloud storage, 
real time databases and much more that will aid in developing a useful application.
